## Description

**The goal of this project is to provide a simulation environment to support the research and development of multi-agent, multi-sensor, surveillance algorithms in large, outdoor environments.**

This project supports the Army Research Laboratory's Internet of Battlefield Things (IoBT) program.

## Running the code

* Add "sim_world" to your PYTHONPATH environment variable.
* Edit multiagent.py to change various program parameters.
* Run it: python multiagent.py
